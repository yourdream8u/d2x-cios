# Problematic disc-based games #

Most Wii games work without any issue. However there are very few games that are still problematic for some reason. See the list below.

Also, note that some out-of-region games might require you to force english language from the loader. Actually they should work if you force any language supported by the game, for example most NTSC games are multi 3: english, french and spanish.
