# Introduction #

You can install d2x cIOS through ModMii or d2x-cIOS-installer. The easiest way is the installer. It installs the cIOS directly, so a WAD Manager is not needed. The installer uses the IOS bases from sd/usb (you can get them via NUS Downloader) or download them using the wii internet connection directly.
ModMii is really good too, but you need Windows to use it. Once you have the wad you can install them with a WAD Manager.

The recommended configuration:
**249**
base 56,
**250**
base 57
