  * **Oggzee**, for his brilliant fraglist.
  * **WiiPower**, for the great help with ios reload block from usb.
  * **dragbe** and **NutNut**, for their [d2x cios installer](http://code.google.com/p/d2x-cios-installer).
  * **XFlak**, for his wonderful [ModMii](http://gbatemp.net/topic/207126-modmii-for-windows) which supported d2x wads since its birth. Without ModMii d2x cios would probably never have existed.
